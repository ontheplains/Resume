Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub account and looking at my resume.  Although I am certainly a junior programmer, I will assure you that I am incredibly dedicated (some might say obsessed) with becoming the best JavaScript developer I can be.  If you have questions, or would like more information, please contact me at 385-315-0052 or justinwritescode@gmail.com.  Cheers!
